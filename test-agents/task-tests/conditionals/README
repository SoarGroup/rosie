Task Test conditionals
Aaron Mininger

This test has the agent learn various tasks that involve conditionals - 
both conditional goals and conditional procedures

# Test Script

1: Teach a task with a non-branching goal 
	If the goal is not true then move to the next node

2: Teach a task with branching goals  + default
	Store with different types of objects and default is to ask

3: Teach a task with non-branching conditional procedure
	Each step in the procedure is a conditional, but the if/else branches re-combine

4: Teach a task with a branching conditional procedure
	The initial branch leads to a completely different path (no merging later)
