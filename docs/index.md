# Rosie ITL Agent

Rosie (RObotic Soar Instructable Entity) is an agent written in the 
Soar Cognitive Architecture that learns new tasks from scratch through situated interactive instruction. 
Rosie is part of research in the emerging area of Interactive Task Learning (ITL), 
and has been used to learn novel games, puzzles, household tasks, perceptual features, 
spatial relations, and hierarchical task concepts.  
What sets Rosie apart is its ability to learn completely new tasks and concepts from a single example 
and generalize its task knowledge in many different situations. 
It does this in an online, interactive manner where it detects missing knowledge and performs 
search or initiates new interactions to obtain that knowledge. 
Rosie is a project at the University of Michigan Soar Lab, led by Professor John E. Laird.

# Videos

## [Interior Guard](https://youtu.be/j9E0UYjGfhY)

![Interior Guard](pics/InteriorGuard.png)

This video from showcases Rosie learning to perform 
an interior guard task in a simulated barracks environment. 
Highlights include learning 'whenever' tasks, composite tasks, 
looping tasks, tasks with conditional actions, and ability to 
interrupt an already learned task to extend behavior. 

## [5-Puzzle with the Fetch robot](https://youtu.be/hc2gcrW96F4)

![Fetch Robot](pics/Fetch_5Puzzle.png)

This video shows Rosie on the Fetch robotics platform solving a game of 5-puzzle after it had been taught through instruction. This is a variation of the 15-puzzle, where you must slide 15 scrambled tiles around to their original places.

## [Kitchen Tasks](https://youtu.be/baoKID1gVqE)

![Kitchen Tasks](pics/KitchenTasks.png)

In this video featuring the ai2thor simulator, 
Rosie learns where to store objects, how to heat something in the microwave, and how to serve water. 
Highlighted capabilities include learning conditional goals, 
learning actions that depend on user preferences, and incorporating temporal conditions into the task. 

## [Learning Fetch](https://youtu.be/dzi-ACmi-2U)

![Fetch Task](pics/MagicbotFetch.png)

In this video featuring the Magicbot, Rosie learns to fetch an object from another location and bring it back. A key step in this task is that Rosie learns to remember the starting location so it can go back there later, thus generalizing to different starting places. 

## [Learning Deliver](https://youtu.be/-i5bSS4CPts)

![Deliver Task](pics/MagicbotDeliver.png)

This video showcases Rosie learning the deliver task with the magicbot platform, 
where the goal is to deliver an object to the specified location.
In the video Rosie also learns to associate a new name with a location. 


## [Tower of Hanoi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jOkKnpaHo)

![Tower of Hanoi](pics/TowerOfHanoi.png)

Rosie learns the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with the
tabletop robotic arm. 

## [8 Puzzle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_65wzFKbTM)

![8 Puzzle](pics/8Puzzle.png)

Rosie learns to solve the 8 puzzle (a variant of the 15 tile sliding puzzle) in 
a simulation of the tabletop robot arm. 

## [Frogs and Toads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZUWEG-yHsI)

![Frogs And Toads](pics/FrogsAndToads.png)

Rosie learns the Frogs and Toads jumping puzzle game. 
The video highlights the structures that are built up to recognize 
the actions, goal, and concepts such as 'placed'.

## Task Learning

**[Learning Hierarchical Symbolic Representations to Support Interactive Task Learning and Knowledge Transfer](papers/Kirk.Learning_Hierarchical_Symbolic_Reps.2019.pdf)** <br>
2019 | *James Kirk, John E. Laird*

This paper explains Rosie's approach to learning hierarchical task concepts used especially
in learning game and puzzle tasks, and demonstrates the ability of the agent to transfer
these concepts to new tasks and resolve ambiguities that arise.

**[Interactively Learning a Blend of Goal and Procedural Tasks](papers/Mininger.Learning_Blended_Tasks.2018.pdf)** <br>
2018 | *Aaron Mininger, John E. Laird*

Explains how the task-learning part of Rosie was extended to learn simple procedural tasks in an integrated manner.


**[Learning Task Goals Interactively with Visual Demonstrations](papers/Kirk.Learning_Task_Goals.2016.pdf)** <br>
2016 | *James Kirk, Aaron Mininger, John E. Laird*
