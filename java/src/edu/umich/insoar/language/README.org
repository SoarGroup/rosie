This code accepts a natural language sentence from the
instructor/mentor and converts it into a Soar readable parse
(described in the MIISI document). The grammar (in MIISI) is only
partially implemented. 

* Dictionary 
Following words can be recognized. The dictionary can be extended by
simply adding to the list in the [[https://github.com/shiwalimohan/sbolt/blob/master/src/edu/umich/sbolt/language/dictionary.txt][file]].  

NOUN: block table ball pantry cylinder
ADJECTIVE: red green blue gray large medium small round square
VERB: put get 
DETERMINER: a the
PREPOSITION: on in from
ATTRIBUTE: color size shape

* Tags
Following linguistic tags have been used for POS tagging and grammar.

| verb-command    		| =VBC= 	| put a red block on the table                                        	|

| sentence        		| =SEN= 	|                                                                     	|
  

* Grammar
Following grammar is supported by this package. Typical regex
operators apply.

Note: extending the tags and grammar can be done by editing the grammar.xml document at:
[[https://github.com/shiwalimohan/sbolt/blob/master/src/edu/umich/sbolt/language/grammar.xml][file]].  

How to extend the grammar
1. Create a new LinguisticEntity. Make sure it has a 'public static String TYPE = "NAME";' property
2. Add a Pattern to the grammar.xml file with the regular expression and tag and use NAME for the EntityType
3. Edit EntityFactory.java so that it can create the LinguisticEntity using the TYPE string
4. implement the methods for the LinguisticEntity interface

: SEN => VBC | GS | REL | PS
: GS => goal of VBC is (REL)*
: PS => VBC if (REL)*
: VBC => (VB) | (VB OBJ) | (VB OBJ PP OBJ)
: REL => OBJ is PP OBJ
: OBJ => DT? JJ* NN
