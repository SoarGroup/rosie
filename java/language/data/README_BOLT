Changes to the dictionary files for BOLT should be indicated here:

data/link/4.0.dict, around line 2733: 
replaced entry for "where" with entry for "what", need to research how LGSoar can handle "where" sentences and why they would be parsed differently anyway

around line 2530: added "left of" and "right of" as idioms similar to "in front of"

data/link/4.0.dict, end: added color names as nouns, copied from abiword version
