# Rosie Settings

## Rosie Config Settings
These settings should be put in the `rosie.config` file given to the RosieAgentConfigurator tool. 

`agent-dir = [str]` The name of the directory to create and copy agent code into 

`agent-name = [str]` The name of the agent (used as root of file names)

`domain = [str]` The domain/environment the agent is running in (e.g. internal or mobilesim)

**Source Files**    
Note: you can add special path prefixes to the files to specify where to look for them:

```
${config-dir} - Resolves to the directory containing the config file
${agent-dir} - Resolves to the agent directory created by the config tool
${rosie-agent} - Resolves to the rosie/agent directory

# Example: 
# Most agents will want to add the default smem config file:
smem-config-file = ${rosie-agent}/_smem_config.txt
```


`source-soar-file = [file]` Will source the given soar file during agent creation

`source-smem-file = [file]` Will source the given smem file during agent creation (also runs it through the lti mapping program and copies it to the agent-dir)

`smem-config-file = [file]` Will analyze the given smem configuration file, which can contain template instantiations or other smem files to map and source

	
**Language/Script Settings**


`parser = [laird|lindes]` Which parser to use

`sentence-source = [scripts|chat]`    
`> chat: ` Instructor sentences are expected on the input-link     
`> scripts: ` Sentences come from an internal script (defined by `sentences-file`) 
and the agent automatically runs through each one

`sentences-file = [file]` A list of sentences (1 per line) to serve as a script    
`- if sentence-source = scripts` these become the script the agent runs through    
`- if sentence-source = chat` these are put as options into the GUI

`parser-test = [bool]` Used for parser development

`hypothetical = [bool]` Used for parser development to control object grounding


## Rosie Client Settings
These are settings that are understood by the RosieClient class 
and read from the `rosie-client.config` file. 
They are used to control how the RosieClient creates the agent and any other 
settings used by the interface layer. 

Normally, you would define these in the `rosie.config` file and they are passed through to the 
auto-generated `rosie-client.config` file by the RosieAgentConfigurator tool. 

**Auto generated by the RosieAgentConfigurator tool**

`source-config = [file]` The file used by the RosieAgentConfigurator to generate this file


`agent-name = [str]` The name used when creating the SoarAgent

`agent-source = [file]` The root soar file that will source all of the productions

`smem-source = [file]` The root soar file that will source all initial smem knowledge

`domain = [str]` The environment/domain this is running in (e.g. internal or mobilesim)


**Running the Agent**

`spawn-debugger = [bool]` If true, will spawn the Java debugger (requires $SOAR_HOME)

`start-running = [bool]` If true, the agent will start running when connect is called

`reconfig-on-launch = [bool] (PYTHON)` If true, will run the RosieAgentConfigurator tool every time the client is started

**Language Settings**

`messages-file = [filename]` A text file containing sentences to use as possible messages to Rosie (populates GUI)


**Controlling Output**

`source-output = full|summary|none` How much output is printed when sourcing files

`watch-level = [int]` The Soar watch/trace level (default = 1)

`write-to-stdout = [bool]` If true, all agent/soar output (e.g. rhs writes) 
will be printed to standard out

`enable-log = [bool]` If true, all agent/soar output (e.g. rhs writes) will be written to a log file

`log-filename = [file]` The name of the log file to write (with `enable-log = true`)



## Rosie Agent Settings (agent-params)

These are parameters/settings that are in working memory
and that the agent can test directly within rules to affect behavior.
Many are used for debugging or testing. 

The recommended approach is to create a local soar file with a production that sets all of these settings, 
and then include it as `source-soar-file = ${config-dir}/local-soar-file.soar`

Most should be placed onto the `([top] ^agent-params [params])` wme on the top state.
