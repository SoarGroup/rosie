evaluation: blending2 

Aaron Mininger

This is the second evaluation for the Diverse Formluations chapter of my thesis
where we are showing different ways that we can blend procedural and goal-based tasks

In this experiment, we give the agent the task of filling a cup and give it a goal
   but it may lack action models about how to use the watercooler
   So it needs to fall back on learning a procedure

# Prerequisites:

* MobileSim java simulator
* Soar built with python3 SML library
* pysoarlib (https://github.com/amininger/pysoarlib) 
* Both the $ROSIE_HOME and $MOBILE_SIM_HOME environment variables set

# Test Script
Will do 1 training and 4 testing versions

There are three agent variations:
Agent 1: Complete agent + button action model
Agent 2: Complete agent with no special action model
Agent 3: Cannot learn procedural subgoals

# Running

# Give the agent number as an argument, NUM=1/2/3
$> make run_evaluation NUM=1
