evaluation: blending3

Aaron Mininger

This is the third evaluation for the Diverse Formluations chapter of my thesis
where we are showing that you can compose different formulations 
together within the same task and hierarchically

In this experiment, we teach the task of giving a tour, which has a number of different tasks within:
- goal-based task (serve drink)
- procedural task (give tour)
- composite task (saying multiple things in the lab)
- maintenance task (following the person)
