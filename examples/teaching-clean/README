Clean task
Aaron Mininger

This evaluation has the agent learn an interior guard task in a barracks.
The agent will patrol a route, inspecting different locations until relieved. 

#This video from showcases Rosie learning to perform an interior guard task in a simulated barracks environment. 
#
#Highlighted Capabilities:
#- Learning 'whenever' tasks which will get triggered when some condition is met and interrupt the current task.
#- Learning tasks with loops.
#- Learning composite tasks where the agent needs to do a set of things in no particular order.
#- Expanded use of conditional actions 
#- Ability to extend behavior later by interrupting an already learned task.
#

# Prerequisites:

* MobileSim java simulator
* Soar built with python3 SML library
* pysoarlib (https://github.com/amininger/pysoarlib) 
* Both the $ROSIE_HOME and $MOBILE_SIM_HOME environment variables set

# Test Script
Will do 3 training and 3 testing serve tasks

# Running
