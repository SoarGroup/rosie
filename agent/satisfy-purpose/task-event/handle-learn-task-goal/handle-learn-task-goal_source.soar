#
# When the instructor describes the goal of the current task, 
#   it pushes a new interaction segment with a purpose of learn-task-goal
# This will trigger satisfy-purpose/task-event/handle-learn-task-goal
#
# In this state, the agent uses construct-task-goal to turn the goal message into 
#    a representation that will be used in the action problem-space to add the goal


# <s> ^interaction-purpose <p>  # from superoperator - the learn-task-goal purpose info
# <s> ^goal-message <msg>       # from interaction-purpose.parameters - the goal to learn
source elaborations.soar
source preferences.soar

# Step 1: Construct the task-goal representation from the goal-message
#         (see problem-space/action/task-utils/construct)
#   adds: <s> ^task-goal <task-goal>
source construct-task-goal.soar

# Step 2: When everything is finished: 
#         Copy the task-goal onto top-state.task-stack.bottom segment
#         Copy the task-operator onto top-state.interaction.stack.segment.purpose.parameters.task-goal
#         (Will retract satisfy-purpose and go into execute-task on the top-state)
