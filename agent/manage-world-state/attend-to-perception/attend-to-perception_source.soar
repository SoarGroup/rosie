### Discrepancies

### new-perception-object
# discrepancy-info.perception-obj <obj>
#   <obj> is from the input-link.objects.object <obj>
# There is a new object on the input-link
# Will incorporate the object into the world, 
#   either adding it or merging it with an existing object

pushd new-perception-object
source new-perception-object_source.soar
popd


### different-robot-status
# discrepancy-info.robot-status <status>
#  OR
# discrepancy-info.arm-status <status>
# There is a change to the status of the robot/arm
# Will update the moving-status on the robot or arm in the world

source different-robot-status.soar


### different-waypoint
# discrepancy-info.waypoint-handle <wp-handle>
# There is a different current-waypoint on the input-link
# Will update the current-waypoint and current-location information
#   and possibly do a context change of removing old objects 
#   and loading new expected ones from epmem

pushd different-waypoint
source different-waypoint_source.soar
popd


### moved-object
# discrepancy-info.object-info <obj-info>
# The positions of the perception-obj and belief-obj significantly differ
# Will either update the belief object pose, or if occluded, ignore the move

### different-object-predicate
# discrepancy-info.object-info <obj-info>
#                 .property-handle <prop>
#                 .predicate-handle <pred>
# An object predicate has changed (e.g. door=closed)
# Will update the given predicate on the object

# discrepancy-info.object-info <obj-info>
#                 .property-handle <prop>
#                 .predicate-handle <pred>
# An status predicate has changed (e.g. visible)
# Will update the given predicate on the object 

source different-object-status.soar

### missing-object
# discrepancy-info.object-info <obj-info>
# A belief object should be visible, but there is no perception object
# Will either fix a tracking error by changing the perception ids, 
#   ignore it because of occlusion, or delete the object from WM

pushd missing-object

### shrunken-object
# discrepancy-info.object-info <obj-info>
# A belief object is much larger than the perception object
# Will either merge with another perception-id, 
#   ignore it because of occlusion, or update the pose

pushd shrunken-object

### grown-object
# discrepancy-info.object-info <obj-info>
# A belief object is much smaller than the perception object
# Will either merge with another missing object
#   or update the pose
