# File: add-text.soar     in System B
# Author: Peter Lindes
# Created: 25 October 2018
#
# Desc: Adds the source and text info to a new construction.
#       Several similar operators are included here:
#           add-word-info   For lexical constructions
#           add-text-span   For composite constructions
#           add-schema-text For schemas
#
#   This operator is intended to be selected
#   in a substate under build-cxn, but it ignores
#   build-cxn and works with everything
#   on the comprehend-word superstate.
#

#    Propose an operator to source and text info to a lexical construction
sp {build-cxn*propose*add-word-info
   (state <s> ^superstate <ss>
             -^text done) #   Retract when this operator completed
   (<ss> ^problem-space comprehend-word
         ^operator <ss-o>
         ^cxn <cxn>
         ^input <input>)
   (<cxn> ^cxn-name <name>)
   #    Get the necessary data
   (<cxn> ^orth <orth>)
   (<input> ^word <word>)
      #    Insure o-support
   (<ss-o> ^name build-cxn)
-->
   (<s> ^operator <o> + =)
   (<o> ^name add-word-info
        ^type construction
        ^cxn <cxn>
        ^word <word>
        ^debug-info (concat |Add the text info to a '| <name> |' construction.|))
}

#   This apply rule sees a lexical cxn and ingests it
#   It adds the source and stubs for the various standard
#   parts of a lexical construction
sp {build-cxn*apply*add-word-info
   (state <s> ^superstate <ss>
              ^operator <o>)
   (<o> ^name add-word-info
        ^cxn <cxn>
        ^word <word>)
   (<word> ^word-count <count>
           ^orth <orth>
           ^content <text>)
   #    This should not be a multi-word
#   (<lex> ^m <meaning>
#         -^multi-word )
#   THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE - IF A SINGLE WORD AND A MULTI-WORD
#   FIRE AT THE SAME TIME WE GET A MESS.
#   THE FOLLOWING CODE DOES NOT WORK TO FIX THAT.  3-21-2016
#   #   Make sure there's not a multi-word firing at the same time
# -{(<s> ^cxn <lex2> <> <lex>
#        ^multi-word )}
#   #    Find the previous stack and lexical
#   (<sss> ^comprehension.cxn-stack <stack>
#          ^comprehension.lex-stack <previous-lex>)
-->
   #   Add various needed augmentations
   (<cxn> ^word <word>  # A link to the input word, can serve to mark as lexical
          ^source <source>
          ^text <text>)
   (<source> ^left <count>
             ^right <count>)
   #    Mark this operator as completed
   (<s> ^text done)
}

#    Propose an operator to source and text info to a composite construction


#    Propose an operator to source and text info to a schema
