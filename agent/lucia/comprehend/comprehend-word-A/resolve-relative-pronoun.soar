# Desc: Looks for the RefDesc a relative pronoun is attached to,
#		and copies over its category and referents to this one.
#
#		The result may be a single item, a set of items,
#		or nothing.
#
#	    For now we treat THIS and THAT the same
#
#		This version handles relative-pronoun cases.
#		The relative-pronoun version will only be proposed if that
#		pronoun has already been attached to something.
#
