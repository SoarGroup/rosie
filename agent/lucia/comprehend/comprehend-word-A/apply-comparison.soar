# Desc: When a RefDesc has referents and a relation,
#		and the relation is a comparative pronoun,
#		apply that relation to the referents.
#
#		The result may be a single item, a set of items,
#		or nothing.
#
#		The operator works in four steps:
#		1. It is proposed if we have ^reference resoloved, a RefDesc, a relation
#			with a comparative preposition, and there is no ^comparison done.
#
#			The proposal creates the operator with two main arguments:
#			the RefDesc to do comparisons on and the relation to apply.
#
#		2. A rule examines the relation and posts on the state both the comparison
#			type to be applied and the reference value to compare to.
#
#		3. A set of rules for each comparison type fire, perhaps multiple times,
#			to check the property of each referent against the reference value.
#			Each referent that passes is posted to the state on a ^comparison-passed
#			wme, and each referent that fails is posted on a ^comparison-failed wme.
#
#		4. Some cleanup rules fire to remove each referent that failed and get rid
#			of all the ^comparison-x wmes.  If none passed, a ^referent nil is put
#			on the RefDesc.  Finally ^comparison done is posted and the operator retracts.
#
#	NOTE: For sizes we assume the possible values are small1, medium1, and large1 and
#			the possible comparison relations are smaller-than1 and larger-than1
#
