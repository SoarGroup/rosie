# File: fill-slot.soar
# Author: Peter Lindes
# Created: 24 September 2015
#
# Desc: When the construction we have just built matches the type
#       of an empty slot in a/the previous construction,
#       use this new construction fo fill the slot.
#
#		3/2/2016: Change this to find the empty slot on the
#		comprehension structure above instead of on the
#		previous construction.  This makes it possible for
#		an empty slot to be filled after some intervening stuff.
#
#		4/12/2016: Put the one for previous back in - needed???
#
#		7/20/2016: Change to not propose if it would skip over stuff.
#		Actually, the idea was to compare the right side of the cxn
#		to be filled with the left side of the filler and only allow
#		the fill-slot to be proposed of they were adjacent, meaning
#		that they must differ by 1.  However, this is not possible
#		with the current ^source data since Soar does not allow
#		arithmetic expressions to do right >= left - 1 on the LHS.
#		So, it appears the only way to do this would be to change
#		all the ^source objects to add a left-1 wme, since you can
#		do arithmetic on the RHS.  For now, we will only explain
#		this option in comments and only implement it when we really
#		need it.
