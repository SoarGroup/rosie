# Desc: Looks up a RefDesc in the context to find its referent.
#		This version is customized for the Rosie environment.
#
#		The result may be a single item, a set of items,
#		or nothing.
#
#	    For now we treat THIS and THAT the same
#
#		This version handles only diectic cases, and grounds
#		a deictic reference to the thing pointed to in the world.
#
#		When this operator is applied, any other alternative
#       lexicals will be deleted by the general selection rule.
#

#    Propose an operator to resolve deictic THIS or THAT
