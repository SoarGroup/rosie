# Desc: Looks up a KnownObject in the context to find its referent.
#       This version is customized for the Rosie environment.
#
#       A KnownObject is an object like "kitchen" that is defined in smem.
#
#       PL 4/23/2018
#       The name has been changed from "lookup-" to "ground-" because,
#       even though the item is stored in smem,
#       conceptually it is part of the world model and not the ontology.
#
#       PL 9/15/2020
#       This is being changed back to "lookup-" since that is really
#       what it is doing. This is not part of the world model or
#       the ontology, smem can also contain know objects.
#

#   Propose an operator to resolve the reference of a KnownObject
