# File: ground-reference-sim.soar
# Author: Peter Lindes
# Created: 8 October 2020
#
# Desc: Looks up a RefDesc in the context to find its referent.
#		This version is customized for the Rosie environment.
#
#		The result may be a single item, a set of items,
#		or nothing.
#
#   THIS VERSION IS FOR RUNNING WITH SIMULATED PERCEPTION
#
#   PL 10/21/2020 There are two versions of this operator,
#   the *no-sim version and the *sim version.
#   This is the *sim version, with -sim in the file name.
#       1.  Each version has its own *propose*ground-reference*
#           rule. The operator proposed has an attibute
#           ^simulated-perception true/false depending on whether
#           agent-params.simulate-perception is true or not.
#       2.  Most of the apply rules do not care, at least now,
#           which version they are fired under. All these rules
#           are commented out in the -sim version of the file.
#       3.  The apply rules where it matters have either *no-sim
#           or *sim appended to their names, they check the
#           ^simulated-perception true/false on the operator,
#           and have appropriate differences in the code.
#       4.  It may well be that, as more sentences are developed,
#           more rules will have to be uncommented and differentiated.
#       5.  The 10/21/2020 version works for the Robot 001
#           sentence: "Move the fork onto the table.",
#           which is the first sentence of the kitchen script.
#       6.  In the 10/21/2020 version, only the *category*not-ONE*
#           and *category*not-ONE*object* apply rules have both versions.
#           The *post-name-filter apply rule has only a *no-sim
#           version for now.
#       7.  It is likely that more work will be needed here.
#
# Details:
#	The ground-reference operator is proposed whenever:
#		1. lexical-access is marked as done
#		2. match-construction is marked as done
#		3. the current ^cxn on the state has a meaning
#			which is a RefDesc
#       4. the ^rosie-category of the RefDesc is not "concept"
#           - these are handled by lookup-concept
#       5. the ^givenness of the RefDesc is not "relative-pronoun"
#           - these should have been resolved previously
#       6. the ^givenness of the RefDesc is not "proper-name"
#           - these are handled by ground-proper-name
#	The operator retracts whenever ^reference resolved is set
#
#	The value of the ^category wme of the RefDesc will be
#	a "ref-desc" having a ^rosie-category value that
#	corresponds to category items in the Rosie ontology.
#
#	The *category version of *apply*ground-reference looks in
#	the world on the top state to find any objects that have
#	the indicated Rosie category.  All those found will be posted
#	on the state with a ^referent wme and a ^category done flag is set.
#	The rule fires once for each candidate found.
#
#	The *category-empty version of *apply*ground-reference
#	looks for the case where no objects in the world have the
#	indicated Rosie category.  It posts ^referent NONE on the state
#	as well as ^category done and ^reference resolved flags.
#	The result is that no referent will be found for this RefDesc.
#
#	Once a set of candidate referents has been posted by the *category
#	rule, they must be filtered by any properties specified.  This is
#	done by posting filters to the state and then applying them
#
#	The *post-name-filter, *post-shape-filter, *post-size-filter, and
#	*post-color-filter rules create filters of these four types.
#	Each filter has ^class and ^value attributes.
#
#	The *apply-filter rule may fire many times.  Each firing removes
#	a single candidate from the set if that candidate does not comply
#	with the requirements of a given filter.  Each firing also removes
#	its filter from the state, which may be reduncant.
#
#	The *remove-filter rule removes any filter which did not apply
#	to any candidate.
#
#	The *modifiers rule looks at the head property description on the 
#	^modifiers list of the RefDesc, posts a filter for it, and replaces
#	the head of the list with the ^next modifier.  Thus as many filters
#	will be applied as needed to apply all the modifiers that were
#	present in the RefExpr.
#
#	Finally either the *done-found or the *done-none rule will fire.
#	For each ^referent on the state after all the filtering is done,
#	that referent will put as a ^referent on the original RefDesc.
#	This will happen multiple times if multiple candidates remain.
#	If no candidates are left, the *done-none rule will put a
#	^referent NONE wme on the RefDesc.
#
#	Whichever *done- rule fires will post ^reference resolved
#	on the state, causing the operator to be retracted.
#

#    Propose an operator to resolve a reference of a RefDesc
#    This rule should fire ONLY when IN SIMULATED PERCEPTION mode
