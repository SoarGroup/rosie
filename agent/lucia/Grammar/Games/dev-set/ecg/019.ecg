//  A Multi-word Lexical
//  This construction implements "the volume of" as a function
//	It also has to have a different meaning as a concept
//	in order to get a lookup for "volume"
//	THIS IS VERY WEIRD! THE GOLD STANDARD IS NOT CONSISTENT!
//	The structure used here with Volume as the main meaning
//	and Function evoked separately makes it possible for
//	lookup-concept to lookup a definition of "volume" in smem.
//	However, of the two instances of "the volume of" in the if
//	clause of this sentence, only the first one needs this
//	to put the necessary piece in the final message.
//	THIS IS VERY WEIRD! THE GOLD STANDARD IS NOT CONSISTENT!
//	Nevertheless, it works.
