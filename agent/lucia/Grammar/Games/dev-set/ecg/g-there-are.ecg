//  This file has the grammar needed to comprehend expressions
//  containing "there is", "there are", etc.
//
//  In the base Rosie grammar a multi-word lexical called THERE-IS
//  was defined. This is too restrictive since we would like to have
//  other forms of finite "to be" in there.
//
//  So, we will comment out that old lexical in the base Rosie grammar
//  and add here a new ThereIs composite cxn that allows for any
//  FiniteToBe after "there."
//
//  We will also have to modify the one place in the Rosie grammar
//  that was using THERE-IS, and create a lexical cxn for "there".
