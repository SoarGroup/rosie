######################### state-elaborations ######################

A collection of different elaboration rules used in the action problem-space

## task-concept-network - the TCN of the current action (matches action-operator.action-handle)
   Will query smem if it is not there

## action-operator - the operator represenation of the current action being performed
   Will copy from superstate, includes rules to deep copy

## desired - Will elaborate the action goal (desired) with ^satisfied true if satisfied in the world

## generalize-argument - Takes a working memory representation of an argument (from an action-operator)
   And generates a semantic memory representation

## ground-argument - Takes a semantic memory representation of an argument
   And generates an instance of it, matched against the world and action-operator

## match-action - Used to match an action-operator against a set of proposed actions

## until-clause - If there is an until clause on the state, 
  Will check it against the world and elaborate ^satisfied true if it is satisfied
