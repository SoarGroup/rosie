### Operator Rep: push-task-segment
(<o> ^name push-task-segment
     ^segment <seg>)

### problem-space
(<ps> ^perception.attend-to-all-perception yes)

### Elaborations
   ^task-stack (from superstate)
   ^segment-to-push (from superstate.operator.segment)

   ^object-slots
	   ^object-slot <obj-slot> # object slot on the TCN's goal predicates or subtask arguments
	   ^explicit <obj-slot>    # If slot also exists on the TCN procedural structure
	   ^implicit <obj-slot>    # The slot is not on the TCN procedural

   ^create-object-rep
      ^source <obj-slot>       # Copied from every implicit object slot
	  ^object-rep <obj>        # A created world object
   
   ^object-to-merge <obj>      # every object on the task operator or created object-rep
   ^merge-object-workspace
      ^source-obj <obj>        # from object-to-merge
	  ^world-obj <wobj>        # The merged object on the top-state world


1. smem-query (retrieve-predicates, retrieve-tcn)
   ^task-concept-network - for the task being pushed
   ^predicate-lti        - smem reps of any predicates being pushed

2. construct-world-object
   For each implicit object argument, construct a corresponding world object

3. attend-to-scene-change (new-object)
   Adds each new object to the world (either imagined-obj or smem-obj)

4. replace-task-object
   If an object in the task-operator was merged with a different world object, 
      replace all references to it with the world object

5. add-predicate-to-world
   If the predicate has ^relation-type existing (e.g. from), add it to the world

6. complete-push-task-segment
   Actually push the segment onto the stack
 
   - Add status complete to the superoperator
   - Remove new-task-segment from superstate and stack
	- Add start-of-execution flag
	- Add the segment onto the stack (copy pointers)
	- Add started-action to the output-link (for debugging/monitoring)
	- Add any objects to the task-stack.task-objects
	- If ^debug-tasks true, print current task structure to stdout
	- If ^print-tasks true, print shorthand for pushed task with !ACTION! prefix

	- If pushing an ask operator, clear any answer predicates
