if a clear location is adjacent to a red block then you can move the red block onto the clear location and move a clear available blue block onto a location that was below the red block,if a block is not on a location then it is available,if a location is not below an object then it is clear,if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object
