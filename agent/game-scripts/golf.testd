The name of the puzzle is golf-solitaire
Load init-golf-sol
Ok
You can move a free block onto a clear garbage,If a location is not below an object then it is clear,If a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free
Load second-golf-sol
If the value of a free block is one less than the value of a top block then you can move the free block onto the top block,If a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free,If a location is not below an object then it is clear,If a block is clear and the position of the block is one then it is top
If the value of a free block is one more than the value of a top block then you can move the free block onto the top block,If a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free,If a location is not below an object then it is clear,If a block is clear and the position of the block is one then it is top
The solution has nine steps
