ok.
if a block is on a location that is adjacent to a clear location then you can move the block onto the clear location.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
If a block matches a location then prefer moving the block onto the location.
if the color of a block is the color of an object then the block is matches the object.
