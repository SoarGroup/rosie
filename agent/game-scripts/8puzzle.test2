ok
if a block is on a location that is adjacent to a clear location then you can move the block onto the clear location,if a location is not below an object then it is clear,if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object
load final-8puzzlerc
the goal is that there are eight matched locations,ok,if the color of a location is the color of the block that is on the location then the location is matched
done
