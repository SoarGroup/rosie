the name of the puzzle is ken-ken
load fail-ken-ken2
ok
if the row of a location is the row of a location and the value of the former location is the value of the latter location then you lose,ok
if the column of a location is the column of a location and the value of the former location is the value of the latter location then you lose,ok
load fail-ken-ken
if the locations in a region are filled and the sum of the values of the region is not ten then you lose,ok,if the blocks have the same section then they are in a region,if the value of a location is more than zero then the location is filled
load final-ken-ken
the goal is that all locations are filled,ok,if the value of a location is more than zero then the location is filled
load init-ken-ken
You can write a number that is between one and four onto an empty location,if the value of a location is absent then the location is empty
the solution has four steps
done
load init-ken-ken
yes
