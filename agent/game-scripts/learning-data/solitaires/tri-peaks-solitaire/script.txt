The name of the puzzle is tri-peaks.
Load init-tri-peaks.
Ok.
You can move a free block onto a clear garbage.
If a location is not below an object then it is clear.
If a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free.
Load second-tri-peaks.
If the value of a free block is one less than the value of a top block then you can move the free block onto the top block.
If a block is clear and the position of the block is one then it is top.
If the value of a free block is one more than the value of a top block then you can move the free block onto the top block.
The solution has nine steps.
Load final-tri-peaks.

If the position of a block is one then it is trashed.
Done.
