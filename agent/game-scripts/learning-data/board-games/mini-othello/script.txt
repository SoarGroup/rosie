Ok.
If the locations between a clear location and a captured location are occupied then you can move an available red block onto the clear location.
If a block is not on a location then it is available.
If a location is below a red block then it is captured.
If a location is not below an object then it is clear.
If a location is below a blue block then it is occupied.
