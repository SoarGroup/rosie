Load init-tourrc.
Ok.
If a clear location is adjacent to a red block then you can move the red block onto the clear location and move a clear available blue block onto a location that was below the red block.
If a block is not on a location then it is available.
If a location is not below an object then it is clear.
If a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
The solution has eleven steps.
