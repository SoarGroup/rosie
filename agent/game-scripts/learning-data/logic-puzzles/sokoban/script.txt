Load init-sokoban.
Ok.
The name of an action is move-block.
If a blue block is adjacent to a clear location then you can move the block onto the location.
If a location is not below an object then it is clear.
If a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
The name of an action is push-block.
If a covered location is between a clear location and a blue block then you can move a block on the covered location onto the clear location plus move the blue block onto the covered location.
