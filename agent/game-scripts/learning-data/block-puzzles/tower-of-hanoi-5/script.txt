The name of the puzzle is tower-of-hanoi-5.
Load init-tower5.
Ok.
You can move a clear block onto a clear object that is larger than the block.
If a location is not below an object then it is clear.
If the volume of a block is more than the volume of an object then the block is larger than the object.
Load final-tower5.
The goal is that there are two clear green locations.
Ok.
Done.
No.
