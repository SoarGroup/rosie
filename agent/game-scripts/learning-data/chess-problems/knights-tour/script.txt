The name of the puzzle is knights-tour.
Load init-atour2.
Ok.
If a clear location is movable from a captured location then you can move a red block onto the clear location and move an available clear blue block onto the captured location.
If a block is not on a location then it is available.
If a location is not below an object then it is clear.
If a location is below a red block then it is captured.
If a location that is alongside a captured location is diagonal with an object that is not next to the captured location then the object is movable from the captured location.
The solution has eleven steps.
Load final-atour2.
The goal is that all locations are covered.
Ok.
If a location is below an object then it is covered.
Done.
Load init-atour2.
