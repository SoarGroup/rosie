the name of the puzzle is eight-puzzle.
load init-8puzzle.
ok.
if a block is on a location that is adjacent to a clear location then you can move the block onto the clear location.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
prefer moving a block that is contained by a center location.
if a block is on a location then the block is contained by the location.
If the number of locations adjacent to another location is four then the location is a center location.
load final-8puzzle.
the goal is that there are eight matched locations.
if the color of a location is the color of the block that is on the location then the location is matched.
ok.
done.
load init-8puzzle.
yes.
