the name of the puzzle is knights-tour.
load init-tour.
ok.
if a clear location is movable from an occupied location then you can move a red block onto the clear location and move a free clear blue block onto the occupied location.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
if a location that is adjacent to an occupied location is diagonal with an object that is not next to the occupied location then the object is movable from the occupied location.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
a location that is below a red block is occupied.
a block that is not on a location is free.
prefer moving a red block onto a constrained location over moving the block onto a protected location.
if the score of a location is two then the location is constrained.
the number of their locations that are attackable by an object is the score of it.
if you can move a block that is on a location onto an object then the object is attackable by the location.
if a location is not constrained then it is protected.
the solution has eleven steps.
load final-tour.
the goal is that all locations are covered.
a location that is below an object is covered.
ok.
done.
load init-tour.
yes.
