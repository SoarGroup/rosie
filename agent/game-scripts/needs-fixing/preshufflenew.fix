you can write a number that is between zero and four onto an empty location.
if the value of a location is absent then the location is empty.
the solution has four steps.
load fail-ken-ken2.
if the row of a location is the row of a location and the value of the former location is the value of the latter location then you lose.
ok.
if the column of a location is the column of a location and the value of the former location is the value of the latter location then you lose.
ok.
load fail-ken-ken.
if the score of the grouped locations is not the value of the result-square of the locations then you lose.
the sum of the value of their blocks is the score of it.
if the blocks are filled and they have the same section then they are grouped.
if the value of a location is more than zero then the location is filled.
if the section of an object is the section of their grouped locations then the object is the result-square of it.
ok.
load final-ken-ken.
the goal is that all locations are filled.
ok.
done.
load init-ken-ken.
