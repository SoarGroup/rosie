the name of the puzzle is stacked-frogs.
load init-stacked-frogs.
ok.
if the number of the locations between a location and a covered location is the number of the blocks that are on the covered location then you can move those blocks onto the former location.
if a location is below an object then it is covered.
load second-stacked-frogs.
prefer moving the blocks that are on the heaviest location.
if an object is not lighter than a location then the former object is heaviest.
if the number of blocks on an object is more than the number of blocks on a location then the location is lighter than the former object.
load final-stacked-frogs.
the goal is that there are three clear locations.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
ok.
done.
load init-stacked-frogs.
