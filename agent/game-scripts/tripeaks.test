the name of the puzzle is tri-peaks
load init-tri-peaks
ok
you can move a free block onto a clear garbage,if a location is not below an object then it is clear,if a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free
load second-tri-peaks
if the value of a free block is one less than the value of a top block then you can move the free block onto the top block,if a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free,if a location is not below an object then it is clear,if a block is clear and the position of the block is one then it is top
if the value of a free block is one more than the value of a top block then you can move the free block onto the top block,if a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free,if a location is not below an object then it is clear,if a block is clear and the position of the block is one then it is top
the solution has nine steps
load final-tri-peaks
the name of the goal is all-trashed,ok,the goal is that all blocks are trashed,if the position of a block is one then it is trashed
done
load init-tri-peaks
yes
