Aaron - Notes about things to still do/fix in Rosie

#### HIGH PRIORITY ####

- Adding and testing mental actions: remember, recall, wait
	- Handle object lifetimes for imagined objects (added from remember, etc)
	- Handling tasks with arguments that are not added to the world (abstract?)
	- Handling tasks to perform once? 

- Magicbot: duplicate object added to world for grabbed object going between rooms

- Issue: when learning move into the fridge, if the fridge isn't visible, the agent will do pick-up first, 
   then realize it can't put the object into the fridge as it planned because the fridge is closed. 
   It doesn't learn the right things here

- Make ask take 2 arguments? (Ask *John* "What time is the meeting?)

#### MEDIUM PRIORITY ####

- Make sure tasks handle failures correctly

- Reduce the volume of information printed for reference-info category LTI's 

- Do we need property-handle on unary predicates?

#### LOW PRIORITY ####

- Verify the tabletop domain

- Verfiy the ai2thor domain

- Fix conflicting if-then construction in constructions-is.soar (between James and Aaron)

- Reconcile plural categories with James

- change partial-predicate to relative-relation?

- Refactor: output-link status values

- Refactor: when moving objects, keeping belief bounds in check

- in smem/relations: relation-type can be removed

- Make a setting in loading smem so that a block is by default excluded unless explicitly included
  (e.g. use for adding the goal of move only if wanted)

- Add README's for task-utils
