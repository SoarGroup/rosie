Aaron - Notes about things to still do/fix in Rosie

#### HIGH PRIORITY ####

- Change how task search returns results: 
  Don't chunk the result, instead, add it to the TCN and learn proposal, 
  Just like when it comes from instruction

- Make action model learning happen during Op-No-Change

- Fix pick-up/put-down actions
	Propose pick-up for objects in current location only
	Propose put-down when matching the goal relation

- Implement select-next-goal as a learning problem in the action problem-space
	Add implicit arguments the state

- Handle object lifetimes for imagined objects (added from remember, etc)

- Handling tasks with arguments that are not added to the world (abstract?)

- Handling tasks to perform once? 

- Magicbot: duplicate object added to world for grabbed object going between rooms

- Issue: when learning move into the fridge, if the fridge isn't visible, the agent will do pick-up first, 
   then realize it can't put the object into the fridge as it planned because the fridge is closed. 
   It doesn't learn the right things here

#### MEDIUM PRIORITY ####

- Make sure tasks handle failures correctly

- Reduce the volume of information printed for reference-info category LTI's 

- Idea: when approaching an object in/on a receptacle/surface, approach that parent instead? 

#### LOW PRIORITY ####

- Verify the tabletop domain

- Verfiy the ai2thor domain

- Fix conflicting if-then construction in constructions-is.soar (between James and Aaron)

- Reconcile plural categories with James

- change partial-predicate to relative-relation?

- Refactor: output-link status values

- Refactor: when moving objects, keeping belief bounds in check

- in smem/relations: relation-type can be removed

- Make a setting in loading smem so that a block is by default excluded unless explicitly included
  (e.g. use for adding the goal of move only if wanted)
